Some of my work:

* [Solve Rational Matrix Equation R-Package](https://github.com/adu3110/Solve-Rational-Matrix-Equation--R-Package)  - Given a symmetrix positive definite matrix Q and a non-singular matrix L, Find symmetric positive definite solution X such that X = Q + L (X inv) L^T

* [HMM-DTD-RF-GBM-DTW](https://github.com/adu3110/HMM-DTD-RF-GBM-DTW) - Hidden Markov Model, Dual time dynamics, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Dynamic time Warping - all in one repo -language used R.

* [Linear-Algebra-Functions](https://github.com/adu3110/Linear-Algebra-Functions) - The purpose of this project is to create a repository of functions for commonly used algorithms in Linear Algebra.

* [Baysian-Event-Study](https://github.com/adu3110/Baysian-Event-Study) - I developed an event study statistics in Bayesian Paradigm of Statistics - Language used R
